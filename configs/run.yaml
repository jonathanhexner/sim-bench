# Sampling configuration for testing/development
# Two supported approaches:
# 
# 1. max_groups (RECOMMENDED): Sample by relevance groups to maintain proper structure
#   * UKBench: 1 group = 4 images, so max_groups=25 means 100 images
#   * Holidays: 1 group = 1 query series (varying sizes)
#   * Ensures all groups are complete for valid metrics
# 
# 2. max_queries (ALSO SUPPORTED): Limit total images/queries
#   * UKBench: Limits total images (may create incomplete groups)
#   * Holidays: Limits number of query series (equivalent to max_groups)
#   * Useful for exact image count control, but may affect metric validity
#
# If both are specified, max_groups takes precedence.
sampling:
  max_groups: 100     # Number of groups to sample (null = all). Recommended: 25 for quick tests
  max_queries:     # Alternate: total images (UKBench) or queries (Holidays)
  random_seed: 42  # For reproducible sampling
