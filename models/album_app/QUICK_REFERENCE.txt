MODELS IN THIS FOLDER
----------------------

1. ava_aesthetic_model.pt (96 MB)
   Purpose: Aesthetic quality scoring (1-10)
   When:    Every image during analysis
   Weight:  50% of selection score

2. siamese_comparison_model.pt (94 MB)
   Purpose: Pairwise A vs B comparison
   When:    Tiebreaking (scores within 5%)
   Weight:  Final decision in close calls


WHERE THEY'RE USED
------------------

Config:  configs/global_config.yaml
Code:    sim_bench/model_hub/hub.py
Scoring: sim_bench/album/selection.py


SELECTION FORMULA
-----------------

composite_score = 50% AVA + 20% IQA + 30% Portrait

If top candidates within 5%:
  → Siamese model compares them
  → Picks winner based on confidence


VERIFY THEY'RE WORKING
-----------------------

1. Restart app
2. Look for in logs:
   "INFO - Loaded AVA model"
   "INFO - Loaded Siamese comparison model"
3. Check Performance tab after running album
