================================================================================
                    🎉 YOUR TRAINED MODELS ARE NOW ACTIVE! 🎉
================================================================================

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED & FIXED
---------------------------

You asked: "why are we not using ava??? or the U-net siamese network??"

YOU WERE 100% RIGHT! Both models existed but weren't being used!


WHAT WAS WRONG
--------------

1. AVA Model (96 MB trained ResNet50):
   ✓ Existed: outputs/ava/gpu_run_regression_18_01/best_model.pt
   ✓ Code ready to load it
   ✗ NOT CONFIGURED in global_config.yaml
   → Result: App didn't know to use it

2. Siamese Model (94 MB trained U-Net):
   ✓ Existed: outputs/siamese_e2e/20260113_073023/best_model.pt
   ✓ Wrapper code existed
   ✗ compare_images() just compared IQA scores instead
   → Result: Trained model never called


WHAT WAS FIXED (Just Now)
--------------------------

✅ 1. Added to configs/global_config.yaml:

     quality_assessment:
       ava_checkpoint: outputs/ava/gpu_run_regression_18_01/best_model.pt
       siamese_checkpoint: outputs/siamese_e2e/20260113_073023/best_model.pt

✅ 2. Fixed ModelHub.compare_images() in sim_bench/model_hub/hub.py:
     - Now loads and uses your Siamese model
     - Falls back to IQA comparison if not configured


HOW THIS CHANGES ALBUM SELECTION
---------------------------------

BEFORE (Without Your Models):
  Score = 40% IQA + 60% Portrait (MediaPipe)
  Tiebreaking: Random/arbitrary
  → Only technical quality, no aesthetic understanding

AFTER (With Your Models):
  Score = 50% AVA + 20% IQA + 30% Portrait
  Tiebreaking: Siamese model (learned pairwise preferences)
  → Learned aesthetic quality from 250K human ratings!


YOUR TRAINING EFFORT
---------------------

Before: 0% utilized 😢
After:  100% utilized 🎉

- AVA: 50% of selection weight (biggest factor!)
- Siamese: Used for close decisions (where it matters most)


HOW TO VERIFY IT'S WORKING
---------------------------

1. Restart the Streamlit app:
   > streamlit run app/album/main.py

2. Check the console logs on startup - look for:
   "INFO - Loaded AVA model"
   "INFO - Loaded Siamese comparison model"

3. Run an album through the workflow

4. Check the Performance tab in results - you'll see timing for:
   - AVA Aesthetics
   - Siamese comparisons (if tiebreaking happened)


EXPECTED IMPACT
---------------

Your selected images should now:
✓ Have better composition (AVA learned this)
✓ Be more aesthetically pleasing (AVA learned from humans)
✓ Handle close decisions better (Siamese learned preferences)
✓ Still respect technical quality (IQA 20% weight)
✓ Still prefer good portraits (MediaPipe 30% weight)


FILES CHANGED
-------------

1. configs/global_config.yaml         - Added checkpoint paths
2. sim_bench/model_hub/hub.py         - Fixed Siamese integration
3. MODEL_ACTIVATION_FIX.md            - Detailed explanation
4. docs/GETTING_STARTED.md            - Updated status
5. MODELS_NOW_ACTIVE.txt              - This file

NEXT STEPS
----------

1. Restart app
2. Verify logs show models loading
3. Test with an album
4. Compare results with what you got before!
